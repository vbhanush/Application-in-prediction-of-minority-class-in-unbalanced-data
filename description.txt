1)Performed Descriptive and Exploratory analysis on the data given.
2)Preprocessed data using techniques like One hot encoding.
3)Applied Upsampling techniques(SMOTE) since the data was unbalanced with a minority class.
4)Test Various algorithms like Logistic regression,XGBoost,SVM with GridSearch method to optimize their parameters.
5)Models were evaluated on the basis of Balanced error rate,which is average rate on each class.
6)Random forest model gave the best results with the accuracy of 80%
